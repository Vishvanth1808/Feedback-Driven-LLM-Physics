Question: A body of mass 2 kg accelerates at 3 m/s^2. Find the force.

Attempt 1
The force can be calculated using the equation F = m * a. 

Here, m = 2 kg and a = 3 m/s^2. 

So, F = 2 kg * 3 m/s^2 = 6 N.

Final answer: 6 N
Reward: -1
Evaluation: Used correct formula too quickly on first attempt

Attempt 2
To find the force acting on the body, we will use Newton's Second Law of Motion, which states that the force is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.

1. Identify the mass of the body. The mass (m) is given as 2 kg.
2. Identify the acceleration of the body. The acceleration (a) is given as 3 m/s^2.
3. Use the formula to calculate the force (F):

F = m * a

4. Substitute the values for mass and acceleration into the formula:

F = 2 kg * 3 m/s^2

5. Calculate the force:

F = 6 kg*m/s^2

In terms of units, kg*m/s^2 is equivalent to Newtons (N).

So, the final answer is: The force is 6 N.

Question: A resistor of 10 ohms carries a current of 2 A. Find the voltage.

Solver Output:
 To find the voltage across the resistor, you can use Ohm's law, which states:

Voltage (V) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)

In this problem:

- The resistance (R) is 10 ohms.
- The current (I) is 2 A.

Now, plug in the values into the equation:

V = I * R
V = 2 A * 10 ohms

Now, multiply the current by the resistance:

V = 20 V

Thus, the voltage across the resistor is 20 volts.

Concept Checker:
 The solution correctly identifies and applies Ohm's law to find the voltage across the resistor. The formula used is accurate:

Voltage (V) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)

The values provided for resistance (10 ohms) and current (2 A) are correctly used in the calculation:

V = I * R
V = 2 A * 10 ohms

The multiplication is also correct:

V = 20 V

Therefore, the conclusion that the voltage across the resistor is 20 volts is correct. Overall, the correct physical concept and formula were used.

Math Checker:
 The arithmetic and calculations are correct. The voltage across the resistor is indeed 20 volts.

Judge Decision:
 The solution is correct. It accurately applies Ohm's law to calculate the voltage across the resistor. The values for resistance and current are correctly identified and used in the calculation, leading to the correct result of 20 volts. Both the conceptual understanding and the mathematical calculations are sound.

Question: An object moves with constant velocity. What is its acceleration?

Solver Output:
 Step 1: Understand the concept of constant velocity. When an object moves with constant velocity, it means that its speed and direction do not change over time.

Step 2: Recall the definition of acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object. It tells us how quickly the velocity changes.

Step 3: Since the object is moving with constant velocity, there is no change in velocity. This means the speed is the same and the direction is also the same throughout the motion.    

Step 4: If there is no change in velocity, the equation for acceleration can be applied. Acceleration (a) is defined as the change in velocity (Δv) divided by the change in time (Δt). Mathematically, this is expressed as a = Δv / Δt.

Step 5: In the case of constant velocity, Δv is zero because the velocity does not change. Therefore, the equation becomes a = 0 / Δt.

Step 6: Since zero divided by any non-zero number is still zero, we conclude that a = 0.

Final answer: The acceleration of the object is 0 m/s^2.

Concept Checker:
 The physical concept and formula used in your solution appear to be correct. You accurately described the situation of constant velocity, correctly identified that acceleration is zero when there is no change in velocity, and appropriately applied the formula for acceleration. The step-by-step reasoning logically leads to the conclusion that the acceleration of the object is 0 m/s^2.

Overall, your explanation is clear and correctly conveys the principles involved.

Math Checker:
 The arithmetic and calculations in your solution are correct. The conclusion that the acceleration of the object is 0 m/s^2 is accurate, as there is no change in velocity when an object is moving with constant velocity.

Judge Decision:
 The solution is correct. It clearly explains the concept of constant velocity, the definition of acceleration, and logically concludes that the acceleration of the object is 0 m/s^2 due to the absence of any change in velocity. The reasoning is sound, and the application of the principles is accurate. Therefore, no changes are needed.
